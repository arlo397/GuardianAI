### **Pitch**
Our project focuses on leveraging the Credit Card Fraud Prediction Dataset available on Kaggle to create a robust containerized web application. This application will utilize databases for efficient data storage and management, enabling user querying and facilitating job queues. By employing Flask, we will develop API endpoints that provide users with access to comprehensive summary statistics and plots derived from the Credit Card Fraud dataset. More importantly, considering the widespread utilization of this dataset for machine learning-based fraud detection, we aim to design our application to accept credit card input for predicting potential fraud from a pre-trained model we develop. This will allow users to submit a job, and retrieve a prediction about whether the particular credit card attributes are likely fraudulent. 

### Importance
This project is essential as it tackles the pressing issue of credit card fraud by using advanced explainable AI techniques on the Credit Card Fraud Prediction Dataset from Kaggle. It will provide a containerized web application that offers real-time fraud prediction, enhancing security measures for financial institutions and protecting consumers from fraudulent transactions.

### Data Source & Description

**Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kelvinkelue/credit-card-fraud-prediction

The dataset "Credit Card Fraud Prediction" is designed to evaluate and compare various fraud detection models. It comprises 555,719 records across 22 attributes, featuring a comprehensive mix of categorical and numerical data types with no missing values. Essential components of the dataset include:

- Transaction Details: Precise timestamps, merchant information, and transaction amounts.
- Fraud Indicator: A binary attribute marking transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, serving as the primary target for predictive modeling.
- Cardholder Information: Names, addresses, job titles, and demographics, providing a deep dive into the profiles involved in transactions.
- Geographical Data: Location details for both merchants and cardholders to explore spatial patterns in fraud occurrences.

This dataset is a rich resource that fosters the development, testing, and comparison of different fraud detection techniques. It is a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners dedicated to advancing the field of fraud detection through innovative modeling and analysis.
